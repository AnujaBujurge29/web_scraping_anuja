While the Japanese government continued to project peace under the disguise of negotiations in Washington, plans went ahead for a surprise military action that would catch the U.S. completely off-guard. One major vulnerability proposed for an attack was the U.S. Fleet's Pearl Harbor base in Hawaii that was reachable by an aircraft carrier force. Taking advantage of this strategic ""loop-hole"" the Japanese Navy secretly sent a naval battle group across the Pacific with greater aerial striking power than had ever been seen on the World's oceans. After sneaking almost undetected past the military's radar, its planes hit the heart of the shipyard just before 8 a.m. killing over two-thousand four-hundred Americans and destroying five of eight battleships and most of the Hawaii-based combat planes."

Although the thin liners were hardly noticeable, many players around the league criticized them as a distraction."

1972,"LIFE, the blueprint for magazine publishing in America folded as a weekly in December of 1972. Though the weekly version's life span covered only thirty-seven years, it is impossible to think of any other magazine that had such an extraordinary impact on the art of photo-journalism. Debuting in 1936, Henry R. Luce and his colleagues at Time Inc. decided to publish a magazine that would take pictures and words to an unprecedented level. Up to then, most newsworthy imagery had been deliberately posed and static, but after the portable 35mm camera was developed in the 1930s, it was discovered that a skilled photographer could take pictures of almost anything, anywhere; at anytime. Most magazines had been built around editors and writers, butLIFEwas very different, as it was entirely been built around its photographers."
1972,"President Richard Nixon defeated Democratic candidate George McGovern by one of the widest margins on record. However, within a few months, his administration was under fire over the so-called ""Watergate"" scandal, stemming from a break-in at the offices of the Democratic National Committee during the 1972 campaign. The break-in was traced to several officials of the Committee to Re-elect the President. As a result, many resigned and some were later convicted of offenses connected with efforts to cover up the affair. Nixon himself denied any personal involvement, but the courts forced him to yield White House tape recordings, which indicated that he had, in fact, tried to interfere with the ongoing investigation."
1972,"On May 12th, the Milwaukee Brewers and Minnesota Twins went head-to-head for twenty-one innings before the one A.M. curfew halted play with the score 3-3. Both teams combined to tie the Major League record for intentional walks during an extra-inning game with seven and the Twins went a step further and tied their own club record by stranding twenty-three men on base. The following day play resumed as the Brewers scored in the top of the twenty-second to win 4-3, but the Twins prevailed with a 4-3 victory of their own in the second outing after fifteen innings. At the end of the day, both games tallied nine hours and twenty-three minutes setting an American League record for the most consecutive innings ever played in a two-day span."
1972,June 4th belonged to the pitchers as a Major League record eight shutouts were pitched in sixteen games.

Carl Yastrzemski of the Boston Red Sox, managed a one-out single in the first for the team's only hit, but Ryan responded by retiring the last twenty-six consecutive batters.

1972,"Unfortunately, Clemente was killed in a plane crash while on a humanitarian mission that was taking supplies to earthquake victims in Nicaragua. The DC-7 aircraft he was flying in went down off the coast of Puerto Rico one-mile from San Juan with no survivors. The four time National League batting champion was only thirty-eight years old and had just won a World Series championship in 1971. As a tribute, he was elected on a special consideration to the National Baseball Hall of Fame with a 93% vote becoming the first Latin American to be inducted into Cooperstown."
1972,"Eighty-six games were cancelled due to the first general players' strike, which was eventually resolved on April 13th. Concessions came after both the owners and players agreed on a $500,000 increase in pension fund payments. In an effort to prevent paying the players for the work stoppage, the league decided not to make up the missed contests. As a result, some teams only played one-hundred fifty-three total games."
1972,"The Philadelphia Phillies' Steve Carlton became the first pitcher at 27-10, to win the Cy Young Award while playing with a last-place team and Rod Carew, of the Minnesota Twins, became the first American League player to lead the league in hitting without ever hitting a single home run."
1972,"The Oakland Athletics' Reggie Jackson set a new trend in baseball after being the first Major League ballplayer to wear a mustache since Wally Schang in 1914. As a result, the A's owner Charles Finley declared June 18th ""Mustache Day"" at the ballpark and offered $300 to each player that could grow one before Father's Day."
1972,"The U.S. Supreme Court confirmed lower court rulings in the Curt Flood case by a vote of 5-3 upholding baseball's exemption from antitrust laws. The decision cleared the way for future legislation or collective bargaining to undercut the reserve system, but proved meaningless after all major league owners agreed to salary arbitration at the end of the season."

1973,"Both players and owners agreed to what was coined as the ""10 and 5 rule"" in which a player with a decade of experience in the majors and five-years with their present team could veto a trade.

2003,"After the U.N. repeatedly failed in its efforts to uncover weapons of mass destruction or identify links between Saddam Hussein and international terrorists, the United States and a group of coalition forces joined together for a pre-emptive strike aimed at disarming Iraq. On March 19th, the U.S. launched what would become known as Operation ""Shock and Awe"" as a ""decapitation attack"" aimed at the Iraqi President and other top members of the country's leadership. More than forty satellite-guided Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired from U.S. warships in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf with support from multiple squadrons of F-117 stealth fighters, carrying 2,000-pound bombs. Although the initial attack failed to eliminate Saddam, it only took twenty-one days for coalition forces to eliminate the Republican Guard and take the capital city of Baghdad. For the first time in history, people from around the world were able to watch the war effort live via embedded war journalists and strategically placed web cams."
2003,"Tragedy struck the NASA Space Program after the space shuttle Columbia broke up during re-entry fifteen minutes before its scheduled landing at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Those killed on the ill-fated flight were commander Rick D. Husband; pilot William C. McCool; payload commander Michael P. Anderson; mission specialists David M. Brown, Kalpana Chawla and Laurel Clark; as well as Israel's first astronaut, Ilan Ramon. An investigation into the explosion later revealed that a piece of foam designed to protect the vehicle from heat had dislodged during take-off, striking the left wing. Columbia, the oldest of NASA's shuttle fleet, had first launched in 1981 and was completing its twenty-eighth mission. Ironically, the accident occurred less than a week after the anniversaries of two other deadly space program disasters: the seventeenth anniversary of the explosion of the shuttle Challenger (January 28) and the thirty-sixth anniversary of a launch pad fire that killed three Apollo astronauts (January 27)."
2003,"New York Yankees ace Roger Clemens joined one of the most exclusive clubs in sports after becoming the twenty-first pitcher in Major League history to win three-hundred games. After announcing his intentions to retire at the end of the 2003 season, Clemens went on to complete his quest for three-hundred by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals, 5-2, in front of a sold-out crowd at Yankee Stadium. In doing so ""The Rocket"" became the first pitcher since Nolan Ryan in 1990 to reach three-hundred wins, tying Hall-of-Famers Early Wynn and Lefty Grove for nineteenth place on the all-time victory list. Later he joined another ""pitching fraternity"" after striking out the four-thousandth batter of his career. Only Nolan Ryan (5,714) and Steve Carlton (4,136) had more strikeouts than Clemens (to date), who had ten on the night. Ironically, Carlton had also won his three-hundredth against the Cardinals in 1983."
2003,"The ongoing rivalry between the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees came to a head during Game 3 of the American League Championship Series after both dugouts emptied twice due to what some felt was ""overly-aggressive"" pitching. The ensuing argument was first instigated after Boston ace Pedro Martinez struck Yankees' designated hitter Karim Garcia in the back and was fueled by Manny Ramirez who took offense to a high pitch thrown by Roger Clemens. As both dugouts cleared, New York's bench coach Don Zimmer charged at Martinez who promptly reacted by throwing the seventy-two year-old to the ground. After several minutes of suspended play, both teams went back to business until a second brawl erupted in the Yankees bullpen between Jeff Nelson, Garcia and a member of Fenway Park's grounds crew. Following the 4-3 Yankees victory, Major League Baseball issued fines to Martinez, Ramirez, Garcia and Zimmer while the Boston Police issued additional charges on Garcia and Nelson for their involvement in the bullpen altercation."
2003,"The entire baseball world was shocked after one of its most beloved athletes Sammy Sosa was ejected in the first inning of a Chicago Cubs versus Tampa Bay Devil Rays game after umpires found cork in his shattered bat. Sosa, who had recently joined the five-hundred home run club and gained national prominence in 1998 during his home-run battle with Mark McGwire, apologized to fans, his teammates and the Commissioner of Baseball. Stating that the corked bat had been strictly used for batting practice and mistakenly taken to the plate, Sosa received a seven-game suspension following an appeal. Sosa's other bats, which had been confiscated by security personnel and turned over to Major League Baseball, showed no signs of tampering. Still, many doubted the integrity of Sammy's previous accomplishments and it would be some time before he would be back in the fan's favor."
2003,"Los Angeles Dodgers closer Eric Gagne set a new Major League record after converting fifty-five saves to top Boston's Tom Gordon, who had previously converted fifty-four in a row from April 19, 1998, to June 5, 1999. Practically ""un-hittable"" throughout the season, Gagne had increased the velocity on his fastball from ninety-two miles-per-hour to ninety-seven and complemented it with a hard eighty-seven mile-per-hour changeup that dropped much like a split-finger pitch. His forty-first consecutive win gave him the longest saves streak to start a season in Major League history and he also became the first relief pitcher in history to tally one-hundred more strikeouts (137) than hits allowed (37)."
2003,"Baltimore Orioles pitcher Steve Bechler collapsed at the team's spring training complex in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on February 16thand died the next day. Following an autopsy, it was determined that the twenty-three year-old had suffered a ""heart attack-like event"" after taking a dietary supplement containing ephedra. His widow later filed a $600 million lawsuit against the manufacturers while bringing national attention to the dangers of using potentially harmful weight loss aids. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Fort Lauderdale, called the product Xenadrine RFA-1 a ""poisonous cocktail"" unsafe for human consumption."
2003,"Major League Baseball's marketing division attempted to restore the fan's faith in the All-Star Game and make amends for the 2002 debacle that had ended in a 7-7 tie after both leagues ran out of available pitchers. To add more meaning to the fledgling exhibition, the 2003 Midsummer Classic slogan read ""This Time It Counts"" and for the first time in professional baseball history, home-field advantage in the World Series would be granted to the winner. The enticing proposal initially appeared to be more than just a marketing ploy as the last team to overcome the ""home-field curse"" was the Pittsburgh Pirates, who had beaten the odds (and the Baltimore Orioles) while away in 1979. However, despite winning 7-6, the American League later proved that home-field advantage was overrated after the Florida Marlins toppled the New York Yankees in Game 6 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium."
2003,"After years of less-than-stellar ratings, record audiences finally tuned in to the Major League Baseball postseason, making it the most-watched playoffs ever on cable. Fans also flocked to the ballparks setting a new attendance mark with over 1,858,979 tickets sold. Many attributed this renewed interest to the playoff's storybook backdrop that featured two of baseball's most beloved underdogs, the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs. Both teams had surprised the experts by making the post season and each continued to shock their opponents by battling back in their respective leagues time and time again. After surviving the Divisional round, generations of long-suffering fans from both ball clubs reveled in the possibility that the curse of both ""The Bambino"" and ""The Goat"" was finally coming to an end. The baseball god's apparently had other plans and both teams fell just five heartbreaking outs short of making it to the Series."

2004,"The Olympics returned to their birthplace (Athens, Greece) amidst a stream of controversies involving the use of illegal performance enhancing drugs. Despite the resulting suspensions and stripped titles, many experts believed the 2004 Games would be remembered for the improvement in drug testing which allowed honest athletes to prevail. One Greek newspaper summed up the media's bemusement at the number of cheaters discovered with a cartoon depicting a young boy, with a gold medal round his neck, being surrounded by microphones saying: ""I am only a volunteer, but everyone else has tested positive."""
2004,"During the summer of 2004, North America, Central America and the Caribbean experienced one of the deadliest hurricane seasons ever recorded. During the months of August and September alone, four major storms (Jeanne, Ivan, Frances, Charley) pounded the southeastern part of the globe killing well over 2,000 people and leaving hundreds of thousands more homeless. As a result, a record setting number of tornadoes (173 in August, 247 in September) were also spawned as the left over tropical depressions moved inland and up the eastern coast. The total cost in damage from winds and flooding was estimated to run well into the multi-billions and was spread from the island of Haiti to upstate New York."
2004,"2004 also marked one of the most widely anticipated presidential elections in recent history. Republican President George W. Bush, son of former President Bush, made a run for a second term after being elected in the hotly contested 2000 campaign. At that time he was mid-way through his second term as governor of Texas, a position he assumed in 1994. Prior to running for governor he spent several years in the oil business and as the managing general partner of the Texas Rangers baseball team. His opponent, Democratic candidate Senator John Kerry was a decorated Vietnam War veteran who returned from the conflict to become one of the most outspoken opponents of the war. After entering politics in 1982, when he was elected lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, he ran for U.S. Senate on a campaign that refused contributions from political action committees. He was reelected in 1986, 1990, 1996 and 2002."
2004,"Baltimore Oriole Miguel Tejada won the 2004 Home Run Derby after edging the Houston Astros' Lance Berkman with five homers in the final round.

Amazingly, Tejada's final five blasts came after five outs, half of the requisite total."
2004,"Seattle Mariners sensation Ichiro Suzuki broke George Sisler's 1920 single season hitting record during an 8-3 victory over the Texas Rangers. With fans still cheering, Suzuki ran to the first-base seats and shook hands with Sisler's 81-year-old daughter and other members of the Hall of Famer's family. After Suzuki's record breaking 258thhit, he scored his 100thrun of the season when the Mariners batted around in the third, taking a 6-2 lead on six hits."
2004,"The Cleveland Indians scalped the New York Yankees with a record-setting 22-0 massacre on August 31st. With the defeat, the Bombers lost their fifth consecutive game in the Bronx for the first time since May of 2003. The twenty-two runs allowed were the most ever given up by the Yankees in their home ballpark and the most runs allowed since 1928, when the Indians won a 24-6 decision (one of two eighteen-run defeats in New York history). The loss also tied the largest margin of defeat in a shutout since 1900, equaling the mark set in 1975 by the Pittsburgh Pirates in a 22-0 win over the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field."
2004,"San Francisco Giant Barry Bonds continued his relentless assault on the major league record books in 2004. His season highlights included: (September 17th) Hit his 700th career homer, off San Diego's Jake Peavy.

2004,"After enjoying a brief, seventy-eight day retirement, Roger Clemens returned to pitch with friend and former teammate Andy Pettitte on their hometown Houston Astros. For more than a year, ""The Rocket"" had insisted that 2003 would be his final season, but all bets were off after the Yankees lost the World Series and Pettitte left New York. Remarkably, the forty year-old, six-time Cy Young winner, returned better than ever becoming a NL Cy Young candidate en route to the National League Championship Series."
2004,"Randy Johnson, of the Arizona Diamondbacks, turned his back on the clock on his amazing career after pitching a perfect game against the Atlanta Braves on May 18th. In doing so, the forty year-old became the first ace to toss a perfect game since David Cone of the New York Yankees accomplished the feat in 1999. He also became the oldest pitcher in baseball history to do so, followed by Cy Young who had reached perfection at the age of 37 in 1904. Johnson's masterpiece came in a 2-0 win at Turner Field that took only two hours and thirteen minutes to complete. Afraid to ""jinx"" the outcome, neither the scoreboard nor public address system noted the history in the making and only displayed Johnson's picture and stats after the final pitch had been made.Around the League...America's ""National Pastime"" returned to the capital for the first time in thirty-three years after Major League Baseball approved the relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington DC. Ironically, the announcement came one day before the anniversary of the original Washington Senators' final game (before moving to Texas) in 1971. The relocation of the Expos was subject to certain contingencies, including a vote by team owners in November and passage of legislation by Washington's City Council to build a ballpark on the Anacostia River waterfront.One day after the death of former baseball star Ken Caminiti (an admitted steroid user) U.S. lawmakers passed legislation allowing tighter government regulation of steroid precursors. In doing so, the Anabolic Steroid Control Act added androstenedione, norandrosterone and similar testosterone-production enhancing substances to a list of anabolic steroids regarded as controlled substances. Caminiti, who had played in the major leagues for fifteen years, died of an apparent heart attack at age forty-one. He had admitted to using steroids during his Most Valuable Player season in 1996, when he hit .326 with forty home runs and one-hundred thirty runs batted in for the San Diego Padres."

2005,"2005 will be remembered as a year in which the world seemed to be peppered with natural disasters including floods, earthquakes, mudslides, wild fires and even a tsunami (late December 2004). Tropical storms reached an all-time high as the National Hurricane Service ran out of letters from the English alphabet for naming them. The eleventh, christened ""Hurricane Katrina,"" first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane in Miami, Florida on August 25, 2005 and then again on August 29th, along the Central Gulf Coast near New Orleans, Louisiana, as a Category 4 storm. The hurricane resulted in several breaches of the levee system that protected New Orleans from Lake Pontchartrain, and most of the city was subsequently flooded by the lake's waters. This and other major damage to the coastal regions of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama made Katrina the most destructive and costliest natural disaster in the history of the United States. In the end, Katrina was responsible for $200 billion dollars in damage, and over 1,200 deaths. In addition, more than one-million people were left displaced, creating a humanitarian crisis unlike anything experienced in modern times."
2005,"""Operation Enduring Freedom"" marked its fourth anniversary, as American military and coalition forces continued their global war on terrorism. Originally launched in October of 2001 (as both a counter attack and pre-emptive strike, following the attacks on September 11th), the Allied Forces targeted far more than al Qaeda training camps and facilities and the repressive Taliban regime in Afghanistan. The ongoing battle against insurgents in Baghdad, the liberation of the Iraqi people, the drafting of an Iraqi Constitution, and the trial of captured dictator Saddam Hussein were just a few of the major issues in an ongoing war that sparked both controversy and debate around the world."
2005,"NASA finally returned to space, after a 2½ year absence, following the accidental explosion and loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia and her seven-member crew (STS-107) over Texas in February of 2003. After a year of investigation, resulting in the institution of several new safety features and protocols, the Space Shuttle Discovery launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center on July 26, 2005. STS-114 included breathtaking in-orbit maneuvers, tests of new equipment and procedures, and a first-of-its-kind space-walking repair. NASA later announced that the next Shuttle mission, STS-121, was targeted for March of 2006 and would be the second test flight to the International Space Station in the ""Shuttle Return to Flight"" series."
2005,"Baltimore Oriole and Dominican superstar Miguel Tejada was awarded the ""Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award"" for his efforts in leading the American League to a 7-5 victory over the National League in the 76th All-Star Game in Detroit. In doing so, Tejada became the fifth Latin-American born player among the last eight MVP winners. The victory increased the American League's unbeaten streak to nine and netted its third straight home-field advantage in the World Series."
2005,"2005 was also the seventeenth (and final) big-league season of one of baseball's perennial journeyman, John Olerud. With a stellar career as a Toronto Blue Jay, New York Met, Seattle Mariner, New York Yankee, and Boston Red Sox, Olerud's resume boasted a .295 average, with 2,239 hits, 7,592 at-bats, two World Championships, three Gold Gloves, and one batting title. Retiring as a first-baseman with the Boston Red Sox, Olerud left behind a wonderful ""blue-collar"" legacy as both a players' player and a fan favorite. Well known for not having played a single game in the minor leagues, Olerud moved directly to the majors after an outstanding career at Washington State University where he was a pitcher. Drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the third round of the 1989 Amateur Draft, he had to wear a batting helmet in the field because of a brain aneurysm in younger life."
2005,"Following in the footsteps of the ""Cinderella-story"" 2004 Boston Red Sox, the Chicago White Sox shocked the baseball world after winning the American League pennant en route to their first World Series since 1959. The forty-six year gap between appearances was the longest in American League history and offered a rare opportunity for some long-overdue redemption for ""Shoeless Joe"" Jackson and his infamous ""Black Sox"" - who were found guilty of throwing the Fall Classic in 1919. The Windy City's south-siders had advanced to the postseason on three other occasions, in 1983 when they lost three of four games to the Baltimore Orioles, in 1993 when the Toronto Blue Jays beat them in six, and in 2000 when the Seattle Mariners dumped them in three. Their last World Championship title had come eighty-eight years earlier when they defeated the New York Giants in 1917."
2005,"Bobby Abreu, of the Philadelphia Phillies, broke the record for most round-trippers after putting up twenty-four in the first round of the Century 21 Home Run Derby during the 2005 All-Star Game. The Venezuelan slugger opened the night by slugging a record twenty-four homers in the first round. He then went on to finish second in the second round (8-6) while earning a spot in the finals. Showing no signs of fatigue, he later added eleven more (another record) en route to the title. His longest homer in the final round was four-hundred fifty-eight feet. When totaled, Abreu's forty-one homers combined to travel an estimated distance of seventeen thousand five-hundred sixty-five feet!"
2005,"After falling short of the postseason in their first forty-two years of existence, the Houston Astros finally weathered the storm, beating the perennial National League East division winners, the Atlanta Braves as well as the National League defending champion St. Louis Cardinals en route to the 2005 World Series. Along the way, Houston and Atlanta set a Major League postseason record with a five hour and fifty minute marathon (sixty seconds longer than a Boston Red Sox-New York Yankees playoff game from the previous season). It ended at 7-6, with a game-winning (and Series ending) home run in the eighteenth-inning, courtesy of Houston's Chris Burke. Aces from both teams combined to throw a whopping five-hundred fifty-three pitches, (Astros: three-hundred, Braves: two-hundred fifty-three) as a forty-three year-old Roger Clemens came unexpectedly ""out of the bullpen"" for his first relief appearance since 1984. Usually a starter, ""The Rocket"" was forced into a closer's role and allowed one hit in three scoreless innings to earn the win."
2005,"In a year filled with parity and mediocrity, the San Diego Padres finished the season with an 82-80 record to avoid becoming the first playoff team to ever finish the season at .500 or under. The Padres actually won more games in 2004 (eighty-seven) and recorded back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since 1991 and 1992. Overcoming a seemingly never-ending string of injuries and ailments, the Padres held on to win the National League West, but were later swept 3-0 by the defending National League Champion St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Divisional Series."
2005,"Fed up with the lack of initiative by Major League Baseball with regard to the latest steroid scandals, the House Government's Reform Committee took its first step toward intervention, by holding a congressional hearing focusing on the problems of doping in baseball. Following the ongoing investigation into the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative known as BALCO, the committee called several past and present players to testify regarding their own knowledge and/or experience with performance-enhancing drugs. (BALCO is a California nutritional supplements company accused of distributing human growth hormones and steroids, as well as Jose Conseco's controversial biography entitled ""Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits, and How Baseball Got Big."") Former All-Time, single-season homerun champion Mark McGwire, Baltimore Orioles stars Rafael Palmeiro and Sammy Sosa and Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling appeared in front of a panel made up of state representatives. Schilling and the Chicago White Sox' Frank Thomas, who gave a statement via videoconference, were invited because of their outspoken views against steroid use. Ultimately hurting the cause more than helping it, Sosa crafted an opening statement in which he said he had never used illegal performance-enhancing drugs. McGwire refused to answer any questions directly, assuming a Fifth Amendment-like stance that ultimately tarnished his legacy in the eyes of many fans. And Palmeiro vehemently denied having used steroids. Unfortunately, ""Raffy"" later went on to become one of the first players to test positive and receive a multiple game suspension. In retrospect, it appeared that the most unpopular member of the panel, Canseco, was apparently the most (if not the only) honest witness."
2005,"The newly relocated Washington Nationals (formerly the Montreal Expos) ended their first season since returning to the nation's capital with an 81-81 record. Even before the 2005 Spring Training season had ended, manager Frank Robinson promised that the Nationals would be a competitive franchise, despite having one of the lowest payrolls in baseball. With a surprise ten-game winning streak, starting in late May, the Nationals proved they were a competent team, capable of playing 500+ ball. By July 3rd, Washington became the third team in baseball to reach the fifty-win plateau and was on a pace to win one-hundred games. The Nationals remained in Wild Card contention until the New York Mets eliminated them from the race on September 25th."
2005,"""To me, defense is foremost. It's always been. The White Sox showed us this year pitching and defense wins to this day. I would certainly trade his (David Ortiz) World Series championship for this (2005) MVP trophy. That's the only reason I play baseball. It's what I'm consumed to do right now."" - New York Yankees Third Baseman Alex Rodriguez on ESPN.com (AP Wire, 11/14/2005)"

2006,"Pluto is a planet. Pluto is not a planet. Pluto is a ""dwarf planet""? In August 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) voted to strip Pluto of its planetary status and relegate it to a new ""dwarf planet"" classification. The IAU decided that, to be called a planet, an object must have three traits: It must orbit the sun, be massive enough that its own gravity pulls it into a nearly round shape, and be dominant enough to clear away objects in its neighborhood. To be admitted to the dwarf planet category, an object must have only two of those traits - it must orbit the sun and have a nearly round shape (moons do not count). In addition to Pluto, Ceres and 2003 UB313, joined the list of dwarf planets."
2006,"The population of the United States officially passed the 300 million mark on Tuesday, October 17, 2006. While it took almost two centuries for the U.S. population to reach 200 million, it took just 40 years to add the last 100 million. The number of people living in America almost tripled in the 20th century, with most of that growth coming just since the 1960s. The United States is now the third most populous nation in the world, behind China and India."
2006,"Two of the richest men in the world also made major headlines in 2006. Microsoft revealed that cofounder, Chairman, and former CEO Bill Gates will be giving up his day-to-day duties at Microsoft. Gates is relinquishing his title of Chief Software Architect now, but will continue to be involved in the company's operations on a daily basis until July 2008. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett, the second richest man in the world, announced his plans to gradually give 85 percent of his wealth to five foundations. The vast majority will go to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, run by Microsoft chairman - and the world's richest man - Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda. The foundation, which has about $30 billion in assets, focuses on world health as well as improving U.S. libraries and schools. Buffett's contribution would double the foundation's current assets."
2006,"Roberto Clemente. Thurman Munson. Davey Allison. Rocky Marciano. Knute Rockne. Payne Stewart. Fourteen members of the 1980 U.S. amateur boxing team. A handful of names among the forty plus athletes and teams that have been killed in plane crashes since 1925. And now Cory Lidle.

2006,"121 runs batted in (4th), 113 runs scored (5th), 35 home runs smashed (7th), a .392 on base percentage (9th), and the reigning American League Most Valuable Player Alex Rodriguez was booed by his home town fans nearly each time he made an out in 2006. Every strikeout, error, ground out took on an odd life of its own in Yankee Stadium this season and had Ted Williams and Mickey Mantle been alive, they would have welcomed him to one of the most unusual clubs in either league."
2006,"The New York Yankees (East), Minnesota Twins (Central), Oakland Athletics (West) and Detroit Tigers (Wildcard) rose to the top in the junior circuit during the 2006 regular season.

Just to keep it interesting, Soriano added a third 40 to the list as he finished with forty doubles creating a 40/40/40 Club of his own."
2006,"On September 24th, San Diego Padres closer extraordinaire Trevor Hoffman surpassed former St. Louis Cardinals great Lee Smith's record of four-hundred seventy-eight career saves then continued pushing the Major League record to four-hundred eighty-two regular-season saves (and counting). Hoffman's game jersey, the game ball, and his cleats were all donated to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and placed on display. Hoffman said, ""It was overwhelming.

No National League team won or loss more than a hundred games during the season and a tight wild card race between as many as ten teams at some points kept the race unpredictably hot throughout most of September."
2006,"Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig's press release reflected the baseball's world's feelings when the legendary Buck O'Neill passed away on friday, October 6,2006, ""Major League Baseball is saddened by the passing of Buck O'Neil. Buck was a pioneer, a legend and will be missed for as long as the game is played.

2007,"The Boston Red Sox rookie class of 2007 deserves special attention.

2007,"The infamous New York Mets meltdown was described in brutal fashion by sportswriter Marty Noble who said on MLB.com that they, ""can't be measured, analyzed or even referenced without acknowledgment of the crash and burn that marked their September.

2008,"""Baseball never promises you a happy ending. In fact, it braces you for failure more than success, so that you fully appreciate the latter. There are 30 teams, and seven of those have advanced to the postseason; the Twins or White Sox loom as the eighth and last. Baseball dooms you to two failures in every three at-bats on average, if you're lucky. And so it goes for ballparks: No Major League stadium ever has gone out a world champ, and thus there will be no last hurrah at either New York yard."" - Sportswriter Mark Newman on MLB.com (09/29/2008, It's a wonderful world in baseball)"

2025,"The Tampa Bay Rays are playing their 2025 regular-season home games at Steinbrenner Field — a capacity of around 11,000 — in Tampa, Florida, the spring training facility of the New York Yankees.

In this system, umpires made initial calls on balls and strikes, but players—specifically the batter, pitcher, or catcher—could challenge these calls.

At its peak, river water covered the infield diamond and lower grandstands with as much as twenty-one feet of water. Taking advantage of a photographic opportunity, Reds pitchers Gene Schott and Lee Grissom rowed a boat out from the center field wall for a once in a lifetime image that appeared in newspapers across the country."
1937,"The American League All-Stars topped the Nationals 8-3 in the Midsummer Classic. However, the biggest story of the contest was a bizarre play that marked the beginning of the end of Dizzy Dean's spectacular career. With two out, Earl Averill cracked a low line drive that caught Dean directly on the front of his foot. Later, in the clubhouse, it was discovered that Dean's toe was broken. Anxious to get back in the game, Dean and the Cardinals management decided he would return to the mound before the toe was fully healed. Their impatience proved costly as the injury affected his delivery, which eventually injured his arm, and ultimately ended his glory days at the tender age of twenty-six."

2003,"After the U.N. repeatedly failed in its efforts to uncover weapons of mass destruction or identify links between Saddam Hussein and international terrorists, the United States and a group of coalition forces joined together for a pre-emptive strike aimed at disarming Iraq. On March 19th, the U.S. launched what would become known as Operation ""Shock and Awe"" as a ""decapitation attack"" aimed at the Iraqi President and other top members of the country's leadership. More than forty satellite-guided Tomahawk cruise missiles were fired from U.S. warships in the Red Sea and Persian Gulf with support from multiple squadrons of F-117 stealth fighters, carrying 2,000-pound bombs. Although the initial attack failed to eliminate Saddam, it only took twenty-one days for coalition forces to eliminate the Republican Guard and take the capital city of Baghdad. For the first time in history, people from around the world were able to watch the war effort live via embedded war journalists and strategically placed web cams."
2003,"Tragedy struck the NASA Space Program after the space shuttle Columbia broke up during re-entry fifteen minutes before its scheduled landing at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Those killed on the ill-fated flight were commander Rick D. Husband; pilot William C. McCool; payload commander Michael P. Anderson; mission specialists David M. Brown, Kalpana Chawla and Laurel Clark; as well as Israel's first astronaut, Ilan Ramon. An investigation into the explosion later revealed that a piece of foam designed to protect the vehicle from heat had dislodged during take-off, striking the left wing. Columbia, the oldest of NASA's shuttle fleet, had first launched in 1981 and was completing its twenty-eighth mission. Ironically, the accident occurred less than a week after the anniversaries of two other deadly space program disasters: the seventeenth anniversary of the explosion of the shuttle Challenger (January 28) and the thirty-sixth anniversary of a launch pad fire that killed three Apollo astronauts (January 27)."
2003,"New York Yankees ace Roger Clemens joined one of the most exclusive clubs in sports after becoming the twenty-first pitcher in Major League history to win three-hundred games. After announcing his intentions to retire at the end of the 2003 season, Clemens went on to complete his quest for three-hundred by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals, 5-2, in front of a sold-out crowd at Yankee Stadium. In doing so ""The Rocket"" became the first pitcher since Nolan Ryan in 1990 to reach three-hundred wins, tying Hall-of-Famers Early Wynn and Lefty Grove for nineteenth place on the all-time victory list. Later he joined another ""pitching fraternity"" after striking out the four-thousandth batter of his career. Only Nolan Ryan (5,714) and Steve Carlton (4,136) had more strikeouts than Clemens (to date), who had ten on the night. Ironically, Carlton had also won his three-hundredth against the Cardinals in 1983."
2003,"The ongoing rivalry between the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees came to a head during Game 3 of the American League Championship Series after both dugouts emptied twice due to what some felt was ""overly-aggressive"" pitching. The ensuing argument was first instigated after Boston ace Pedro Martinez struck Yankees' designated hitter Karim Garcia in the back and was fueled by Manny Ramirez who took offense to a high pitch thrown by Roger Clemens. As both dugouts cleared, New York's bench coach Don Zimmer charged at Martinez who promptly reacted by throwing the seventy-two year-old to the ground. After several minutes of suspended play, both teams went back to business until a second brawl erupted in the Yankees bullpen between Jeff Nelson, Garcia and a member of Fenway Park's grounds crew. Following the 4-3 Yankees victory, Major League Baseball issued fines to Martinez, Ramirez, Garcia and Zimmer while the Boston Police issued additional charges on Garcia and Nelson for their involvement in the bullpen altercation."
2003,"The entire baseball world was shocked after one of its most beloved athletes Sammy Sosa was ejected in the first inning of a Chicago Cubs versus Tampa Bay Devil Rays game after umpires found cork in his shattered bat. Sosa, who had recently joined the five-hundred home run club and gained national prominence in 1998 during his home-run battle with Mark McGwire, apologized to fans, his teammates and the Commissioner of Baseball. Stating that the corked bat had been strictly used for batting practice and mistakenly taken to the plate, Sosa received a seven-game suspension following an appeal. Sosa's other bats, which had been confiscated by security personnel and turned over to Major League Baseball, showed no signs of tampering. Still, many doubted the integrity of Sammy's previous accomplishments and it would be some time before he would be back in the fan's favor."
2003,"Los Angeles Dodgers closer Eric Gagne set a new Major League record after converting fifty-five saves to top Boston's Tom Gordon, who had previously converted fifty-four in a row from April 19, 1998, to June 5, 1999. Practically ""un-hittable"" throughout the season, Gagne had increased the velocity on his fastball from ninety-two miles-per-hour to ninety-seven and complemented it with a hard eighty-seven mile-per-hour changeup that dropped much like a split-finger pitch. His forty-first consecutive win gave him the longest saves streak to start a season in Major League history and he also became the first relief pitcher in history to tally one-hundred more strikeouts (137) than hits allowed (37)."
2003,"Baltimore Orioles pitcher Steve Bechler collapsed at the team's spring training complex in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, on February 16thand died the next day. Following an autopsy, it was determined that the twenty-three year-old had suffered a ""heart attack-like event"" after taking a dietary supplement containing ephedra. His widow later filed a $600 million lawsuit against the manufacturers while bringing national attention to the dangers of using potentially harmful weight loss aids. The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Fort Lauderdale, called the product Xenadrine RFA-1 a ""poisonous cocktail"" unsafe for human consumption."
2003,"Major League Baseball's marketing division attempted to restore the fan's faith in the All-Star Game and make amends for the 2002 debacle that had ended in a 7-7 tie after both leagues ran out of available pitchers. To add more meaning to the fledgling exhibition, the 2003 Midsummer Classic slogan read ""This Time It Counts"" and for the first time in professional baseball history, home-field advantage in the World Series would be granted to the winner. The enticing proposal initially appeared to be more than just a marketing ploy as the last team to overcome the ""home-field curse"" was the Pittsburgh Pirates, who had beaten the odds (and the Baltimore Orioles) while away in 1979. However, despite winning 7-6, the American League later proved that home-field advantage was overrated after the Florida Marlins toppled the New York Yankees in Game 6 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium."
2003,"After years of less-than-stellar ratings, record audiences finally tuned in to the Major League Baseball postseason, making it the most-watched playoffs ever on cable. Fans also flocked to the ballparks setting a new attendance mark with over 1,858,979 tickets sold. Many attributed this renewed interest to the playoff's storybook backdrop that featured two of baseball's most beloved underdogs, the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs. Both teams had surprised the experts by making the post season and each continued to shock their opponents by battling back in their respective leagues time and time again. After surviving the Divisional round, generations of long-suffering fans from both ball clubs reveled in the possibility that the curse of both ""The Bambino"" and ""The Goat"" was finally coming to an end. The baseball god's apparently had other plans and both teams fell just five heartbreaking outs short of making it to the Series."
2003,"""It's probably the biggest moment of my professional career (winning 9-6 in Game 7 versus Chicago)I can't even explain it. It probably hasn't even sunk in yet, but I do know that it's a wonderful feeling. People asked me was I going to come back for next year, and I told them if I get in the World Series and manage the All-Star team, I'll definitely be back."" - Florida Marlins Manager Jack McKeon"

2004,"The Olympics returned to their birthplace (Athens, Greece) amidst a stream of controversies involving the use of illegal performance enhancing drugs. Despite the resulting suspensions and stripped titles, many experts believed the 2004 Games would be remembered for the improvement in drug testing which allowed honest athletes to prevail. One Greek newspaper summed up the media's bemusement at the number of cheaters discovered with a cartoon depicting a young boy, with a gold medal round his neck, being surrounded by microphones saying: ""I am only a volunteer, but everyone else has tested positive."""
2004,"During the summer of 2004, North America, Central America and the Caribbean experienced one of the deadliest hurricane seasons ever recorded. During the months of August and September alone, four major storms (Jeanne, Ivan, Frances, Charley) pounded the southeastern part of the globe killing well over 2,000 people and leaving hundreds of thousands more homeless. As a result, a record setting number of tornadoes (173 in August, 247 in September) were also spawned as the left over tropical depressions moved inland and up the eastern coast. The total cost in damage from winds and flooding was estimated to run well into the multi-billions and was spread from the island of Haiti to upstate New York."
2004,"2004 also marked one of the most widely anticipated presidential elections in recent history. Republican President George W. Bush, son of former President Bush, made a run for a second term after being elected in the hotly contested 2000 campaign. At that time he was mid-way through his second term as governor of Texas, a position he assumed in 1994. Prior to running for governor he spent several years in the oil business and as the managing general partner of the Texas Rangers baseball team. His opponent, Democratic candidate Senator John Kerry was a decorated Vietnam War veteran who returned from the conflict to become one of the most outspoken opponents of the war. After entering politics in 1982, when he was elected lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, he ran for U.S. Senate on a campaign that refused contributions from political action committees. He was reelected in 1986, 1990, 1996 and 2002."
2004,"Baltimore Oriole Miguel Tejada won the 2004 Home Run Derby after edging the Houston Astros' Lance Berkman with five homers in the final round. The All-Star shortstop set two MLB records in the process by hitting a total of twenty-seven round-trippers for the night and fifteen in the second round. Amazingly, Tejada's final five blasts came after five outs, half of the requisite total."
2004,"Seattle Mariners sensation Ichiro Suzuki broke George Sisler's 1920 single season hitting record during an 8-3 victory over the Texas Rangers. With fans still cheering, Suzuki ran to the first-base seats and shook hands with Sisler's 81-year-old daughter and other members of the Hall of Famer's family. After Suzuki's record breaking 258thhit, he scored his 100thrun of the season when the Mariners batted around in the third, taking a 6-2 lead on six hits."
2004,"The Cleveland Indians scalped the New York Yankees with a record-setting 22-0 massacre on August 31st. With the defeat, the Bombers lost their fifth consecutive game in the Bronx for the first time since May of 2003. The twenty-two runs allowed were the most ever given up by the Yankees in their home ballpark and the most runs allowed since 1928, when the Indians won a 24-6 decision (one of two eighteen-run defeats in New York history). The loss also tied the largest margin of defeat in a shutout since 1900, equaling the mark set in 1975 by the Pittsburgh Pirates in a 22-0 win over the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field."
2004,"San Francisco Giant Barry Bonds continued his relentless assault on the major league record books in 2004. His season highlights included: (September 17th) Hit his 700th career homer, off San Diego's Jake Peavy. (September 11th) Broke his own record for walks in a season and became the first player to earn two-hundred free passes in one campaign. (August 29th) Recorded his sixty-eighth career multi-homer game, passing Mark McGwire for second all-time. (August 13th) Singled in his 1,813thrun, passing Frank Robinson for fourteenth on the all-time RBI list. (July 10th) Broke his own record for intentional walks in a season with the first of three in the game. (July 8th) Passed Eddie Murray (5,397) for eighth place on the all-time total bases list.

(June 12th) Homered off the 400thdifferent pitcher of his career, Baltimore's Rodrigo Lopez. (May 28th) Hit his tenth career walk-off homer, a two-run shot off Colorado's Tim Harikkala. (April 29th) Hit his 668thcareer homer, giving him and his late father Bobby a combined one-thousand home runs. (April 17th) Scored his 2,063rdrun, putting him alone in seventh place all-time, with a solo homer off Los Angeles' Darren Dreifort.

(April 12th) Hit his 660thcareer homer, off Milwaukee's Matt Kinney, to tie godfather Willie Mays for third on the all-time list."
2004,"After enjoying a brief, seventy-eight day retirement, Roger Clemens returned to pitch with friend and former teammate Andy Pettitte on their hometown Houston Astros. For more than a year, ""The Rocket"" had insisted that 2003 would be his final season, but all bets were off after the Yankees lost the World Series and Pettitte left New York. Remarkably, the forty year-old, six-time Cy Young winner, returned better than ever becoming a NL Cy Young candidate en route to the National League Championship Series."
2004,"Randy Johnson, of the Arizona Diamondbacks, turned his back on the clock on his amazing career after pitching a perfect game against the Atlanta Braves on May 18th. In doing so, the forty year-old became the first ace to toss a perfect game since David Cone of the New York Yankees accomplished the feat in 1999. He also became the oldest pitcher in baseball history to do so, followed by Cy Young who had reached perfection at the age of 37 in 1904. Johnson's masterpiece came in a 2-0 win at Turner Field that took only two hours and thirteen minutes to complete. Afraid to ""jinx"" the outcome, neither the scoreboard nor public address system noted the history in the making and only displayed Johnson's picture and stats after the final pitch had been made.Around the League...America's ""National Pastime"" returned to the capital for the first time in thirty-three years after Major League Baseball approved the relocation of the Montreal Expos to Washington DC. Ironically, the announcement came one day before the anniversary of the original Washington Senators' final game (before moving to Texas) in 1971. The relocation of the Expos was subject to certain contingencies, including a vote by team owners in November and passage of legislation by Washington's City Council to build a ballpark on the Anacostia River waterfront.One day after the death of former baseball star Ken Caminiti (an admitted steroid user) U.S. lawmakers passed legislation allowing tighter government regulation of steroid precursors. In doing so, the Anabolic Steroid Control Act added androstenedione, norandrosterone and similar testosterone-production enhancing substances to a list of anabolic steroids regarded as controlled substances. Caminiti, who had played in the major leagues for fifteen years, died of an apparent heart attack at age forty-one. He had admitted to using steroids during his Most Valuable Player season in 1996, when he hit .326 with forty home runs and one-hundred thirty runs batted in for the San Diego Padres."

2005,"2005 will be remembered as a year in which the world seemed to be peppered with natural disasters including floods, earthquakes, mudslides, wild fires and even a tsunami (late December 2004). Tropical storms reached an all-time high as the National Hurricane Service ran out of letters from the English alphabet for naming them. The eleventh, christened ""Hurricane Katrina,"" first made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane in Miami, Florida on August 25, 2005 and then again on August 29th, along the Central Gulf Coast near New Orleans, Louisiana, as a Category 4 storm. The hurricane resulted in several breaches of the levee system that protected New Orleans from Lake Pontchartrain, and most of the city was subsequently flooded by the lake's waters. This and other major damage to the coastal regions of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama made Katrina the most destructive and costliest natural disaster in the history of the United States. In the end, Katrina was responsible for $200 billion dollars in damage, and over 1,200 deaths. In addition, more than one-million people were left displaced, creating a humanitarian crisis unlike anything experienced in modern times."
2005,"""Operation Enduring Freedom"" marked its fourth anniversary, as American military and coalition forces continued their global war on terrorism. Originally launched in October of 2001 (as both a counter attack and pre-emptive strike, following the attacks on September 11th), the Allied Forces targeted far more than al Qaeda training camps and facilities and the repressive Taliban regime in Afghanistan. The ongoing battle against insurgents in Baghdad, the liberation of the Iraqi people, the drafting of an Iraqi Constitution, and the trial of captured dictator Saddam Hussein were just a few of the major issues in an ongoing war that sparked both controversy and debate around the world."
2005,"NASA finally returned to space, after a 2½ year absence, following the accidental explosion and loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia and her seven-member crew (STS-107) over Texas in February of 2003. After a year of investigation, resulting in the institution of several new safety features and protocols, the Space Shuttle Discovery launched from NASA's Kennedy Space Center on July 26, 2005. STS-114 included breathtaking in-orbit maneuvers, tests of new equipment and procedures, and a first-of-its-kind space-walking repair. NASA later announced that the next Shuttle mission, STS-121, was targeted for March of 2006 and would be the second test flight to the International Space Station in the ""Shuttle Return to Flight"" series."
2005,"Baltimore Oriole and Dominican superstar Miguel Tejada was awarded the ""Ted Williams Most Valuable Player Award"" for his efforts in leading the American League to a 7-5 victory over the National League in the 76th All-Star Game in Detroit. In doing so, Tejada became the fifth Latin-American born player among the last eight MVP winners. The victory increased the American League's unbeaten streak to nine and netted its third straight home-field advantage in the World Series."
2005,"2005 was also the seventeenth (and final) big-league season of one of baseball's perennial journeyman, John Olerud. With a stellar career as a Toronto Blue Jay, New York Met, Seattle Mariner, New York Yankee, and Boston Red Sox, Olerud's resume boasted a .295 average, with 2,239 hits, 7,592 at-bats, two World Championships, three Gold Gloves, and one batting title. Retiring as a first-baseman with the Boston Red Sox, Olerud left behind a wonderful ""blue-collar"" legacy as both a players' player and a fan favorite. Well known for not having played a single game in the minor leagues, Olerud moved directly to the majors after an outstanding career at Washington State University where he was a pitcher. Drafted by the Toronto Blue Jays in the third round of the 1989 Amateur Draft, he had to wear a batting helmet in the field because of a brain aneurysm in younger life."
2005,"Following in the footsteps of the ""Cinderella-story"" 2004 Boston Red Sox, the Chicago White Sox shocked the baseball world after winning the American League pennant en route to their first World Series since 1959. The forty-six year gap between appearances was the longest inAmerican League history and offered a rare opportunity for some long-overdue redemption for ""Shoeless Joe"" Jackson and his infamous ""Black Sox"" - who were found guilty of throwing the Fall Classic in 1919. The Windy City's south-siders had advanced to the postseason on three other occasions, in 1983 when they lost three of four games to the Baltimore Orioles, in 1993 when the Toronto Blue Jays beat them in six, and in 2000 when the Seattle Mariners dumped them in three. Their last World Championship title had come eighty-eight years earlier when they defeated the New York Giants in 1917."
2005,"Bobby Abreu, of the Philadelphia Phillies, broke the record for most round-trippers after putting up twenty-four in the first round of the Century 21 Home Run Derby during the 2005 All-Star Game. The Venezuelan slugger opened the night by slugging a record twenty-four homers in the first round. He then went on to finish second in the second round (8-6) while earning a spot in the finals. Showing no signs of fatigue, he later added eleven more (another record) en route to the title. His longest homer in the final round was four-hundred fifty-eight feet. When totaled, Abreu's forty-one homers combined to travel an estimated distance of seventeen thousand five-hundred sixty-five feet!"
2005,"After falling short of the postseason in their first forty-two years of existence, the Houston Astros finally weathered the storm, beating the perennial National League East division winners, the Atlanta Braves as well as the National League defending champion St. Louis Cardinals en route to the 2005 World Series. Along the way, Houston and Atlanta set a Major League postseason record with a five hour and fifty minute marathon (sixty seconds longer than a Boston Red Sox-New York Yankees playoff game from the previous season). It ended at 7-6, with a game-winning (and Series ending) home run in the eighteenth-inning, courtesy of Houston's Chris Burke. Aces from both teams combined to throw a whopping five-hundred fifty-three pitches, (Astros: three-hundred, Braves: two-hundred fifty-three) as a forty-three year-old Roger Clemens came unexpectedly ""out of the bullpen"" for his first relief appearance since 1984. Usually a starter, ""The Rocket"" was forced into a closer's role and allowed one hit in three scoreless innings to earn the win."
2005,"In a year filled with parity and mediocrity, the San Diego Padres finished the season with an 82-80 record to avoid becoming the first playoff team to ever finish the season at .500 or under. The Padres actually won more games in 2004 (eighty-seven) and recorded back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since 1991 and 1992. Overcoming a seemingly never-ending string of injuries and ailments, the Padres held on to win the National League West, but were later swept 3-0 by the defending National League Champion St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Divisional Series."
2005,"Fed up with the lack of initiative by Major League Baseball with regard to the latest steroid scandals, the House Government's Reform Committee took its first step toward intervention, by holding a congressional hearing focusing on the problems of doping in baseball. Following the ongoing investigation into the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative known as BALCO, the committee called several past and present players to testify regarding their own knowledge and/or experience with performance-enhancing drugs. (BALCO is a California nutritional supplements company accused of distributing human growth hormones and steroids, as well as Jose Conseco's controversial biography entitled ""Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits, and How Baseball Got Big."") Former All-Time, single-season homerun champion Mark McGwire, Baltimore Orioles stars Rafael Palmeiro and Sammy Sosa and Boston Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling appeared in front of a panel made up of state representatives. Schilling and the Chicago White Sox' Frank Thomas, who gave a statement via videoconference, were invited because of their outspoken views against steroid use. Ultimately hurting the cause more than helping it, Sosa crafted an opening statement in which he said he had never used illegal performance-enhancing drugs. McGwire refused to answer any questions directly, assuming a Fifth Amendment-like stance that ultimately tarnished his legacy in the eyes of many fans. And Palmeiro vehemently denied having used steroids. Unfortunately, ""Raffy"" later went on to become one of the first players to test positive and receive a multiple game suspension. In retrospect, it appeared that the most unpopular member of the panel, Canseco, was apparently the most (if not the only) honest witness."
2005,"The newly relocated Washington Nationals (formerly the Montreal Expos) ended their first season since returning to the nation's capital with an 81-81 record. Even before the 2005 Spring Training season had ended, manager Frank Robinson promised that the Nationals would be a competitive franchise, despite having one of the lowest payrolls in baseball. With a surprise ten-game winning streak, starting in late May, the Nationals proved they were a competent team, capable of playing 500+ ball. By July 3rd, Washington became the third team in baseball to reach the fifty-win plateau and was on a pace to win one-hundred games. The Nationals remained in Wild Card contention until the New York Mets eliminated them from the race on September 25th."

In August 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) voted to strip Pluto of its planetary status and relegate it to a new ""dwarf planet"" classification. The IAU decided that, to be called a planet, an object must have three traits: It must orbit the sun, be massive enough that its own gravity pulls it into a nearly round shape, and be dominant enough to clear away objects in its neighborhood. To be admitted to the dwarf planet category, an object must have only two of those traits - it must orbit the sun and have a nearly round shape (moons do not count).

2007,Imagine for a moment seeing either Tiger Woods or Roger Federer text-messaging between a round or a set. Now imagine that they had text-messaged each other so they could schedule a face-to-face meeting.

2007,"The Boston Red Sox rookie class of 2007 deserves special attention. Whether it was the media frenzy surrounding the signing of Dice-K, the no-hits allowed by Clay Buchholz (in only his second major league start), the little sparkplug called Dustin Pedroia, the rookie reliever (27 holds) / Pitcher of the Month Hideki Okajima, and lets not forget the first player of Navajo descent Jacoby Ellsbury, these youthful and highly energetic rookies infused the club with energy and enthusiasm that helped them capture their first division title in twelve years."

2007,"The infamous New York Mets meltdown was described in brutal fashion by sportswriter Marty Noble who said on MLB.com that they, ""can't be measured, analyzed or even referenced without acknowledgment of the crash and burn that marked their September.

At the All-Star break Tom Glavine said ""I'd be shocked if we've already played our best baseball.""

They're a reminder to all of us that there are no magic formulas in this game they play.They remind us that you don't need a bunch of old guys with October experience to win. They remind us that you don't need to lead the league in numbers -- any numbers -- to win. In this sabermetric age we live in, we forget that teams like this are possible -- teams that are more than the sum of any of their statistical parts. But they are possible, all right."" - Columnist Jayson Stark on ESPN.com (10/06/2007)"

2008,"Six months of baseball wasn't enough in the Central to determine who would receive the final playoff spot. The White Sox defeated the Indians, 5-1, on the final scheduled day of the regular season while the Twins beat the Royals, 6-0, to keep the Twins a half-game ahead of Chicago in the American League Central. That half-game made it necessary for Chicago to make up a September 13th rainout against Detroit. The White Sox won the makeup game forcing a tiebreaker game which they also won to truly earn a sport in the postseason."
2008,"Shea Stadium opened for business on April 17, 1964. More than forty former players and managers were on hand to watch the New York Mets close out their regular season in what would become the final game in Shea Stadium history — for the second successive year, they were eliminated by the Florida Marlins.

2008,"Josh Hamilton put on a home run slugging display that was simply beyond phenomenal during the 2008 Home Run Derby. MLB.com columnist Mychael Urban said the balls hit by Hamilton, ""bordered on ridiculous"" and we could not agree more."
2008,"The trade deadline used to be a thing of excitement; would your team get a big slugger, another ace, a dominant bullpen pitcher, a solid fielder, or some other piece of their postseason puzzle. The past few years have been a let down for most teams as big names did not seem to change, 2008 was different as these stars changed to new constellations: Ken Griffey, Jr., Rich Harden, Manny Ramirez, CC Sabathia & Mark Teixeira."
2008,"""Baseball never promises you a happy ending. In fact, it braces you for failure more than success, so that you fully appreciate the latter. There are 30 teams, and seven of those have advanced to the postseason; the Twins or White Sox loom as the eighth and last. Baseball dooms you to two failures in every three at-bats on average, if you're lucky.

(Number one in the National League) This ranking is somewhat based on the assumption that eventually Carlos Correa will come to an agreement with the Mets, but as we've watched this play out, there's really no way of knowing where the shortstop (or is he a third baseman?) will land. Let's just say the Mets are our No. 2 pick based on a few seemingly strong free-agent signings and the fact that they were just really good in '22, despite how sourly the season ended. But be warned: Things can unravel for an older team, and the Mets are going to employ a starting rotation with a lot of miles on some of their arms."" - Footer, Alyson.

With runners on base, the timer resets if the pitcher attempts a pickoff or steps off the rubber (collectively called a ""disengagement""). Only two disengagements are allowed per plate appearance; however, this count resets if a baserunner advances. Mound visits, injury timeouts, and offensive team timeouts do not count against this. On a third disengagement, an unsuccessful pickoff attempt will cause that runner to advance one base.

2025,"The Oakland Athletics began playing their home games at Sutter Health Park in Sacramento for the 2025 MLB season. This move follows the expiration of their lease at the Oakland Coliseum and serves as a temporary arrangement until their new stadium in Las Vegas is completed, projected for 2028. Sutter Health Park, a Triple-A ballpark with a capacity of around 14,000, offers a more intimate setting compared to the Coliseum. Despite fan frustrations over the relocation, ticket sales have surged, reflecting a mix of curiosity and support for the team during this transitional period.

2025,"The Tampa Bay Rays are playing their 2025 regular-season home games at Steinbrenner Field — a capacity of around 11,000 — in Tampa, Florida, the spring training facility of the New York Yankees.

Francona, who previously managed the Cleveland Guardians, brings a wealth of experience and a winning pedigree. His arrival has sparked optimism in Cincinnati, with players and fans hopeful that his leadership can guide the team back to playoff contention after a disappointing 77-85 season in 2024. The Marlins appointed Clayton McCullough, formerly the first base coach for the Los Angeles Dodgers, as their new manager. This marks McCullough's first managerial role at the major league level. The Marlins are in a rebuilding phase after a challenging 62-100 season in 2024. McCullough's fresh approach and emphasis on developing young talent have given the organization hope for a brighter future, even as they navigate the challenges of a transitional period."
2025,"During the 2025 MLB Spring Training, the league tested the Automated Ball-Strike System (ABS), a hybrid approach combining human umpiring with Hawk-Eye technology. In this system, umpires made initial calls on balls and strikes, but players—specifically the batter, pitcher, or catcher—could challenge these calls.

The partnership, which began in 1990, included iconic broadcasts like ""Sunday Night Baseball"" and exclusive rights to events such as the Home Run Derby and Wild Card Series."
